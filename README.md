Users may navigate the site by using the NavBar at the top. 

Clicking on "Neighbors" will take them to a page that will allow them to enter information about themselves (including information on pets, kids, and vehicles, as well as rankings). They can also view information about other neighbors who have been added.

Clicking on "The Board" will take them to the neighborhood blog, where they can peruse categorized and date-stamped messages posted by registered neighbors (no anonymous posts here).

If the user is registered and would like to add to the conversation on the Board, they can click "Post." Post will take them to a simple blog-type form that will allow them to select the category of their post, add title and text, and select their own name from the last drop-down menu. If they would like to edit or delete their posts, they simply navigate back to the board and use the buttons on each post.
